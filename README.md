# Right-Left-Coronary-Artery-Classification

This project was completed as part of the "Computer Science in Medicine" course and focused on binary classification of images obtained from coronary angiography. It is part of a larger project aimed at automating the workflow of coronary angiography to accelerate the work of doctors. The dataset used in the project came from a collaboration with one of the hospitals in Krakow, which provided access to anonymized patient data. For the classification, the ResNet18 architecture and binary masks of coronary vessels were used.
